# GorgonizeGames_Template_V01
This project contains a custom-developed template and is specifically designed for hypercasual game projects. It has been created with the aim of making hypercasual game development processes more efficient and minimizing repetitive tasks. Shaped by my personal experiences and needs, the project supports core objectives such as rapid prototyping, user experience enhancement, and easy customization.
